# Ushabti parser

Algorithm to recognize different ushabti features from a screen capture from Spelunky 2 game.

Very much a work in progress.

I got this idea while playing Spelunky 2 and found this room full of ushabti figurines.
This probably doesn't help me solve the mystery in the game, but I wanted to see what it would
take to recognise shapes and symbols from limited possibilities (three faces, five symbols, handful of colors).

Input:

## TODO

- Details step to recognise different faces and symbols
- Print out result in plaintext
- Add other colors besides green
